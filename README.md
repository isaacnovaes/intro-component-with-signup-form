## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- CSS animation

### Continued development

This challenge was easy to be concluded. What I liked the most was that I had the opportunity to practice JS, meanly form input validation. Also, although it was my first sign-up project, I think that I designed a project that can be used in real life. Therefore, I am satisfied with what I have achieved by studying JS for 2 months.
